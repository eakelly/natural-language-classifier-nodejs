The training data I chose to classify for this project was about calendar events. My goal for the assignment was to train the Natural Language Classifier to distinguish between school related events and non-school related events (i.e. a typical calendar event). In addition, another objective was to train the Classifier so that it would correctly categorize words it has not been trained on.
